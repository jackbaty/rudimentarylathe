It's not fine to tell someone their photographs are wrong.</p><p>I'd like to move past Emacs but I cannot quit Org mode no matter how hard I try.</p><p>Added this wiki's RSS feed to my <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://baty.net/feeds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everything Feed</a></p><p>I wish we'd do away with <mark>daylight saving time</mark>, but mostly so everyone would stop complaining about it. For some, I'm sure a time change can complicate their lives, but for most people, it's one lost hour of sleep, once a year. And most clocks don't even need to be reset. I don't understand the outrage.</p><p>It bothers me when people ask questions on Twitter, etc. because so often it's just an obvious grab for "engagement"</p><p>Spent the evening in the darkroom. Took longer than I planned but still beats binge watching some show I don't care about.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>🌨  Light snow, mist +18°F</p><p>I like the approach of <mark>pushing the wiki throughout the day</mark>, but only including it in the RSS feed later. I feel like that caters to both those few who care to keep up frequently and those that just want to be reminded via a feed that there's something new.</p><p>I've <mark>revived my photography-specific <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Instagram">Instagram</a> account</mark>: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.instagram.com/jackbatyphoto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@jackbatyphoto</a>. My "regular" account is more about friends and family sharing so I tend to avoid getting to photo-nerdy there. I think it's good for me to have a place I can focus on photos, cameras, process, etc.</p><p>Pretty happy with the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://baty.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WordPress blog</a> and this wiki at the moment. Removed references to daily.baty.net for now, since I've stopped posting there. Of course this is subject to change. I'm trying to <mark>focus on the writing and not so much on the mechanisms by which I write</mark>. WordPress makes blogging easy and TiddlyWiki makes keeping a linked set of daily notes and information easy. Easy is good right now.</p><p><img src="files/2022/20220311-Q1000391.jpg">

     <description><![CDATA[<p>☀️ Clear +15°F</p><p>The more I use <mark>CamelCase to name files</mark>, the more I'm tempted to use it for Tiddler Titles. </p><p>Phil often <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youneedastereo.com/#2022-03-11%20Journal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">links to audio software</a> and I click the link and arrive at a page showing some of the most fun-looking interfaces I've seen in years. Then, I read the descriptions and I don't understand a word they're saying. The tools look like should, pardon the pun, push all the right buttons for me, but I don't know anything about music, sound, etc.</p><p>Some days it feels like the entire world is <mark>nothing but speculation and gossip</mark>.</p><p>I still love listening to vinyl, but haven't bought any new records in a while. I may sort through my collection and cull the stuff I'll <em>never</em> listen to again. I'll trade them all for some new vinyl. Now that I've canceled Qobuz, I've also thought about <mark>ripping my vinyl to Hi-Res digital</mark>. Probably with this: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.whathifi.com/sony/ps-hx500/review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sony PS-HX500 review, What Hi-Fi?</a></p><p>I've misplaced my slogan mug.</p><p>I'm not typically drawn to "pop" music, but "Prioritize Pleasure" by Rebecca Taylor is wonderful:</p><blockquote><div>You're beautiful and I want the best for you, but I also hope you fail without me</div></blockquote><p>And this one:</p><blockquote><div>Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counter-productive</div></blockquote><p>I bought the 24-bit FLAC.</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mtd_jlV61mA" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p>There are people who write things because it's how they think or feel or what they know about something. This is great. However, much of the internet today reads as if written by people who only care about writing things that make other people (in their own tribe, of course) like them more. The <mark>difference between creating and simply performing</mark> is critical.</p><p>"Personal Knowledge Graph" JFC we need to get over ourselves.</p><p>Is it some sort of requirement that everyone must try to write <mark>something profound about covid</mark>?

     <description><![CDATA[<p>🌨  Light snow, mist +19°F</p><p>I'm going to try leaving off the  tag on these entries until later in the day, so that when the item shows up in RSS feeds, there's something there to read.</p><p>It's funny, 'cause it's true:</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Me: I would like five ice cubes<br>Fridge: here's two<br>Me: okay three more<br>Fridge: okay here's 27 ice cubes scattered across your entire kitchen</p>— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) <a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1502159083872264196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <safe-script async="true" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></safe-script></p><p>I spent an hour yesterday looking through the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Textpattern">Textpattern</a> documentation after seeing a website built with it. I used Textpattern for my blog for a year or two, but that was a <em>very</em> long time ago. Wonder why I'm looking at it again now?</p><p>After reading a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://micro.blog/jack/12573679" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Micro.blog thread</a> on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Espanso">Espanso</a>, I learned it's available on macOS so I'm giving it a try.</p><p>And after that whole <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#2022.03.10%20-%20TW%3A%20Added%20RSS%20Feed">RSS Feed thing yesterday</a>, I learn about this: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/saqimtiaz/tw5-feeds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saqimtiaz/tw5-feeds: Experimental plugin to add support for RSS and JSON feeds to TiddlyWiki</a></p><p>It's cool that things I put into Daybook.org and Events.org and Todo.org files all show up nicely in my Emacs agenda view.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>It's possible that I now have an RSS feed for this wiki. Let me know if it doesn't work for you: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml</a>. I know, I know, one of the "features" of the wiki is that I can post stuff without it bothering anyone. On the other hand, it's kind of a nuisance when it's me looking to see what other people have been writing, so I'm making it easier for people like me to follow someone like me :).</p><p>Well darn, it seems like every time I update and republish the wiki, the RSS feed gets a new entry if the daily tiddler has changed. That's not ideal, of course. UPDATE: I've added a <code>guid</code> element to try and prevent this. Let's see if it works. UPDATE 2: Seems to work.</p><p>I'd canceled my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#MicroDotBlog">MicroDotBlog</a> subscription but today it finally expired. I didn't like how that felt so I re-subscribed immediately :). Still at <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://jack.micro.blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jack.micro.blog</a>
