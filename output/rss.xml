     <description><![CDATA[<p>🌨  Light snow, mist +19°F</p><p>I'm going to try leaving off the  tag on these entries until later in the day, so that when the item shows up in RSS feeds, there's something there to read.</p><p>It's funny, 'cause it's true:</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Me: I would like five ice cubes<br>Fridge: here's two<br>Me: okay three more<br>Fridge: okay here's 27 ice cubes scattered across your entire kitchen</p>— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) <a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1502159083872264196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <safe-script async="true" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></safe-script></p><p>I spent an hour yesterday looking through the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Textpattern">Textpattern</a> documentation after seeing a website built with it. I used Textpattern for my blog for a year or two, but that was a <em>very</em> long time ago. Wonder why I'm looking at it again now?</p><p>After reading a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://micro.blog/jack/12573679" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Micro.blog thread</a> on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Espanso">Espanso</a>, I learned it's available on macOS so I'm giving it a try.</p><p>And after that whole <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#2022.03.10%20-%20TW%3A%20Added%20RSS%20Feed">RSS Feed thing yesterday</a>, I learn about this: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/saqimtiaz/tw5-feeds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saqimtiaz/tw5-feeds: Experimental plugin to add support for RSS and JSON feeds to TiddlyWiki</a></p><p>It's cool that things I put into Daybook.org and Events.org and Todo.org files all show up nicely in my Emacs agenda view. The problem is I <em>never</em> go back and look at prior days in my agenda.</p><p>This is wild: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://blog.myheritage.com/2022/03/introducing-livestory-give-voice-to-your-family-stories/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Introducing LiveStory: Make Your Family Photos Speak - MyHeritage Blog</a></p><p>I've failed Wordle in 3 out of my last 5 attempts. I suck at Wordle.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>It's possible that I now have an RSS feed for this wiki. Let me know if it doesn't work for you: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml</a>. I know, I know, one of the "features" of the wiki is that I can post stuff without it bothering anyone. On the other hand, it's kind of a nuisance when it's me looking to see what other people have been writing, so I'm making it easier for people like me to follow someone like me :).</p><p>Well darn, it seems like every time I update and republish the wiki, the RSS feed gets a new entry if the daily tiddler has changed. That's not ideal, of course. UPDATE: I've added a <code>guid</code> element to try and prevent this. Let's see if it works. UPDATE 2: Seems to work.</p><p>I'd canceled my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#MicroDotBlog">MicroDotBlog</a> subscription but today it finally expired. I didn't like how that felt so I re-subscribed immediately :). Still at <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://jack.micro.blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jack.micro.blog</a>

<em>One of those days, I see.</em></p><p>Your channel would be better without those LEDs in the background.</p><p>I had this crazy thought today of simply copying and pasting each day's note from here into Substack.

     <description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The following Elisp code exports your Org mode agenda files to an iCalendar file. iCalendar (or ICS) is a standard for exchanging calendaring information. If you host this file on a web server, it can be consumed by any calendar application that supports iCalendar.

I've included my Daybook in the agenda, which means I also get a list of things I logged each day in my Calendar app.</p>]]>     </description></item>
