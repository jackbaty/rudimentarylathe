     <description><![CDATA[<p>It's possible that I now have an RSS feed for this wiki. Let me know if it doesn't work for you: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml</a>. I know, I know, one of the "features" of the wiki is that I can post stuff without it bothering anyone. On the other hand, it's kind of a nuisance when it's me looking to see what other people have been writing, so I'm making it easier for people like me to follow someone like me :).</p><p>Well darn, it seems like every time I update and republish the wiki, the RSS feed gets a new entry if the daily tiddler has changed. That's not ideal, of course. UPDATE: I've added a <code>guid</code> element to try and prevent this. Let's see if it works. UPDATE 2: Seems to work.</p><p>I'd canceled my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#MicroDotBlog">MicroDotBlog</a> subscription but today it finally expired. I didn't like how that felt so I re-subscribed immediately :). Still at <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://jack.micro.blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jack.micro.blog</a>

<em>One of those days, I see.</em></p><p>Your channel would be better without those LEDs in the background.</p><p>I had this crazy thought today of simply copying and pasting each day's note from here into Substack. You know, like <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://thelathe.substack.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that newsletter</a> I was trying last year.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://substack.com/app?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_content=writer-dashboard-box" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Introducing the Substack app</a>.

     <description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The following Elisp code exports your Org mode agenda files to an iCalendar file. iCalendar (or ICS) is a standard for exchanging calendaring information. If you host this file on a web server, it can be consumed by any calendar application that supports iCalendar.

I've included my Daybook in the agenda, which means I also get a list of things I logged each day in my Calendar app.</p>]]>     </description></item>
