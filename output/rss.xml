Love when that happens, but they should <em>always</em> send a notice of renewal in advance.</p><p>Every email I send using <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Mu4e">Mu4e</a> goes to spam. I have no idea why but I'm back to Mail.app because who needs that kind of grief.</p><p>I learned today that an <mark>app I built back in the early 2000s is still being used</mark> and the company still loves it.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>If I did all this in support of something bigger, that would be one thing.

Quitting social media. Quitting your phone. Quitting some service. It's almost a certainty that you or I won't be adding anything new to the conversation. Maybe just quit without telling everyone.</p><p>Heh. I spent 2 hours today in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#TheBrain">TheBrain</a> and thinking about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#OmniFocus">OmniFocus</a>. I considered moving project stuff out of Emacs and into TheBrain. While looking for information about a project, I found it easily in Emacs and org-roam made it easy to spot related information so I quit. <mark>Emacs is great and fine</mark> and I should just stop thinking about anything else.</p><p>How many times do I have to say "<mark>I don't care about X</mark>" before I realize that lately I don't care much about <em>anything</em>?

     <description><![CDATA[<p>☁️   Overcast +24°F</p><p>Earlier this week I wrote this:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I don't want to have to decide where to publish things. I want to publish things everywhere and let my mood guide me.
</p></blockquote><p>I don't think that's right. What I think I meant was this:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>I don't want to have to decide where to publish things. I want to only have one place to publish them so I don't have to decide.
</p></blockquote><p>I spent too much time yesterday messing with the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#ThinkPad%20X1%20Carbon">ThinkPad X1 Carbon</a> trying to get it upgraded. The Regolith updates caused the thing to hang on boot so <mark>I figured I'd give Pop!_OS another go</mark> but that wouldn't boot if I opted for encryption during the install. Ok fine, let's go simple with Linux Mint. That installed fine, so I started down the path of getting all my shit installed but realized I'd shedded all of my syncing and shared configuration worries when I got down to a single Mac. So I started moving my dotfiles, fish config, etc. to shared folders that I could sync with Syncthing (which I had to re-install). Then of course the Emacs config had Mac-specific paths and such. I shut the ThinkPad and think I'll put it back in storage. It's not time for Linux yet. When and if it is, it's going to have to be <em>all</em> Linux. I'm not interested in doing the multi-OS thing anymore. </p><p>I don't understand these. They look nice, but they're still just nice fake Speedmasters. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#%20OMEGA%C2%AE%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.omegawatches.com%2Fstories%2Fjoint-mission-launch-bioceramic-moonswatch">Joint Mission: Launch of the BIOCERAMIC MoonSwatch </a></p>]]>     </description></item>

(UPDATE: Nah, I don't think so)</p><p>I've been <mark>writing online</mark> for more than 20 years.  Mostly about writing online.</p><p>I feel like playing with <mark>Linux</mark> today.</p><p>After a couple of weeks with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Espanso">Espanso</a>, I'm quite happy with it. I wish that the configuration files were somewhere more convenient. And that <code>espanso edit</code> used my $EDITOR like it's supposed to, but the actual expansion features have quite easily replaced those in Keyboard Maestro.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>🌦   Light rain +39°F</p><p>I've spent hours configuring my Org-roam setup so I can publish certain notes as a website. It's so cool, but in the end I'm not sure it offers clear advantages over this wiki other than that I can make some of my roam notes public without needing to rewrite them in TiddlyWiki.

I may be posting at <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://daily.baty.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">daily.baty.net</a> for a bit until I get it out of my system.
